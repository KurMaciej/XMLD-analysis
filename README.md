# XMLD-mla
This software application was specifically designed to simplify the time-consuming process of analyzing XMLD (X-ray Magnetic Linear Dichroism) and XNLD (X-ray Natural Linear Dichroism) spectra.
When employing these techniques, a typical spectrum encompasses a background signal and a series of distinctive peaks, each corresponding to the absorption edges of the elements within the sample.
Proficient data analysis reveals valuable insights into the magnetic structure of the specimen.

The program offers a range of powerful features, including:
1. Automated Background Removal: Effortlessly eliminate background noise, ensuring that your spectral data is pristine and ready for analysis.
2. Peak Detection: Identify peaks with precision, utilizing the option for both automated and manual detection. This grants you complete control over your results, ensuring accuracy and reliability.
3. Automated Calculations: Perform calculations based on the detected peaks, extracting critical information about the magnetic properties of your sample.
4. Data Visualization: Generate intuitive plots and graphs to visualize your results swiftly, facilitating a comprehensive understanding of the sample's magnetic characteristics.
5. Export and Compatibility: Seamlessly export your results to a CSV file, enabling compatibility with various other data visualization tools and programs for further analysis.
6. User-Friendly Interface: A User-friendly interface simplifies and accelerates the entire analysis process, ensuring that even users with minimal expertise can navigate and benefit from the program's capabilities.
